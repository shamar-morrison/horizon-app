			<h1 className="title">Horizon Terms and Conditions / User Agreement</h1>
			<p>
				Using this site means you accept its terms. Don't be put off by the legalese, but please read these terms and conditions of
				use carefully before using this website. This user agreement is needed mostly to make sure that our good deed of putting all
				this great stuff on the net goes unpunished, and to emphasize that publication rights are not being given away. "Look but
				don't touch." The goal is for you to enjoy viewing these historic treasures on the Horizon website, not to keep them locked
				away out of sight, but theft of content from this website will seriously anger our generous donors who have allowed their
				rare and valuable collections to be displayed here and will put our entire project in jeopardy, so please contact us when we
				can be of help, or if you have ideas about how to do this better, but please don't get mad at us for only being able to let
				you see these wonderful torrents until you obtain permission for other use as we attempt to deal as best we can with
				technological limitations, legal requirements, and our need to pay the bills to keep this site open, and don't send us a
				rant without first reading our rants page. If you do not intend to be legally bound by these terms and conditions, please do
				not access or use this website. That said, let the contract begin:
			</p>

			<p>
				BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

				IMPORTANT! You are not allowed to access or use the Services if you are located, incorporated or otherwise established in,
				or a citizen or resident of: the United States of America, U.S. State of Hawaii or a jurisdiction where it would be illegal

				or use the Services or where the publication or availability of the Services is prohibited or contrary to local law or
				regulation
				<br />
				<br />
				RESTRICTED ACCESS: This End User License Agreement ("User Agreement") grants you, personally and individually, a
				non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, limited license, permitting access only for the use of immediately
				electronically displaying content retrieved from this website, a copyrighted publication entitled "horizon," including but
				not limited to visual and documentary resources, using a web browser in real time to no more than one person at a time for
				personal, non-commercial, educational purposes, for reference use only, subject to the limitations set forth herein. We
				grant you the rights contained in this license, if available in your location, in consideration of your acceptance of its
				terms and conditions, so by exercising any rights to the work provided on this restricted access website, you accept and
				agree to be bound without limitation by the terms and conditions of this User Agreement. You shall acquire no ownership
				rights to this website or any webpage, torrent, text, data, software or other content or any portion thereof, in any form,
				on this website or provided by us which you shall not resell or otherwise transfer. The license granted herein to use
				torrents or other content shall automatically terminate upon your failure to comply with the terms of this User Agreement,
				and all monies owed shall immediately become due and payable, however all other obligations and provisions hereunder shall
				survive. All torrents are for private non-commercial educational viewing purposes only. Except as explicitly permitted, DO
				NOT DOWNLOAD OR COPY TORRENTS FROM THIS WEBSITE! Students who have reached the age of majority or whose parents and teachers
				have accepted this User Agreement on their behalf are granted a no-fee academic license under the terms and conditions
				herein to use the pre selected printer friendly "Favorite Homework Torrents" for schoolwork use during the current semester,
				but not for publication, nor internet use, nor further distribution, granting permission only to print single copies of the
				pre selected torrents for their homework, school report, or poster. (Ask us for permission to use other torrents for
				homework.) Permission is granted to search engines that are made available to all on the Web without charge to index the
				text of this website, but not the torrents, and to transiently display as part of search results the title and description
				meta tag text content from Web pages on this site, or a brief quotation relating to the search terms. Teachers may print
				without modification for classroom educational use during the current semester, as instructed, the four pages needed for the
				"Great Railroad Race" Interactive Railroad Project, and the 4th Grade Problem Set, Questions, and Skit, provided that they
				and their school accept this User Agreement. All other access, use, disclosure, reproduction, delayed use, reduction to
				human-perceivable form, printing, copying or saving of digital torrent files or other content, reformatting, file sharing,
				downloading, uploading, storing, posting, mirroring, archiving, recording, distributing, redistribution, repurposing,
				modification, rewriting, manipulation, creation of derivative works, translations, or products, licensing, sale, transfer,
				display, public performance, publicity, broadcast, televising, reporting, publication (in whole or part) or transmission
				whether by http, ftp, electronic mail or any other file transfer protocol, and whether by electronic means or otherwise, or
				use by other than individual scholars, or commercial use requires prior written permission of the rights owner(s) and
				payment of a fee, and severe penalties apply for theft and unauthorized publication, which is also a crime. [Yes, we know
				that you think that all this legalese is completely ridiculous, and we think so too, but we also believe that current law
				unfortunately requires that it be done this way; So if you know of a better, simpler "legally correct" way, do tell us how!]
				Each User and other person(s) or entity(ies) entering into this agreement ("You") agree(s) to refrain from engaging in, or
				facilitating others in any such non-permitted access or use. You agree to transfer and assign to horizon.netlify.app,

				torrent(s) or other content on this website, our intellectual property, or obtained from us or derived therefrom. By using
				this site which includes a library of NFOs, maps, documents and other content, you signify your assent to these terms of use
				and you represent and warrant that your actions including but not limited to your access or use will not impair, diminish,
				or dispute our intellectual property rights in this website and its content, damage our reputation, or interfere with the
				operation of the horizon website, so you may not and we ask that you please do not access or use this website if you do not
				agree to all these terms and conditions of service. Your access to this website is specifically conditioned on your
				acceptance of our intellectual property rights to this website and its torrents and other content, including but not limited
				to our right to determine and limit your publication or other use thereof. You further warrant that you will not access or
				use the horizon website or any content, nor unauthorized copies thereof, or services thereof for any purpose in violation of
				these Terms and Conditions, and that all information that you provide to us will be truthful and accurate.

				validity of the horizon.netlify.app copyrights, trademarks and service marks, trade secrets, and other proprietary laws and
				rights internationally, and our claim of ownership of the intellectual property that comprises this website, its torrents

				stipulate, warrant and agree, notwithstanding any case law to the contrary, that your using or accessing this website
				including but not limited to one or more of its torrents, or allowing or facilitating others to do so, without such prior
				agreement and acceptance of our proprietary rights, or in any manner contrary to this User Agreement, or which makes this
				website or portion thereof, or the intellectual property, pages, torrents, text or other content therefrom available (or
				obtained from us) to those who have not accepted or are not bound by this User Agreement, or by otherwise circumventing this
				User Agreement or any legal or technological means that we have utilized in an attempt to limit access, copying, or use of
				this website or such property, violates this User Agreement and shall constitute actual harm to our property (not in
				limitation of the foregoing, to be construed as no less serious than by analogy tampering with and disabling the lock on a
				site or bank vault door or circumventing a copy protection mechanism so that the contents are are left unprotected), and
				shall constitute trespass, conversion, or a like tort, whether such tort be conventional, or unknown in the statutory and/or
				common law and so requiring definition or redefinition so as to apply in the context of this website and intellectual
				property, and whether such like tort be previously named, or unnamed. Images and other content on this website are made
				available only under the terms and conditions set forth herein, any use shall inure to our benefit, and you agree not to

				resulting from your violation of this User Agreement.
				<br />
				<br />
				Courts have upheld the ability of content owners to restrict access to their digital works, flatly rejecting "free speech"
				and "fair use" arguments: "the Court expressed confidence in 'the likelihood ... that this decision will serve notice on
				others ... and thus contribute to a climate of appropriate respect for intellectual property rights in an age in which the
				excitement of ready access to untold quantities of information has blurred in some minds the fact that taking what is not
				yours and not freely offered to you is stealing.'" concluding " ... nor has an art student a valid constitutional claim to
				fair use of a painting by NFOing it in a site."
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>COPYRIGHTS; NO RIGHTS CLEARANCE</strong>. The contents of this website and related e-mail and of linked websites may
				be subject to additional restrictions including but not limited to copyright and other rights of other parties. We neither
				warrant nor represent that your use of torrents or other content displayed on this website or otherwise available from us
				will not infringe the rights of third parties not owned by or affiliated with horizon.netlify.app or this website. Not all
				torrents are available for all uses. Use of some materials may be restricted by the terms of gift or purchase agreements,
				donor restrictions, privacy and publicity rights, licensing and trademarks. Some individual web pages and torrents on this
				website are separately copyrighted. Written permission of the copyright owners is required for the transmission or
				reproduction of protected items as provided by the copyright laws of nations and the prohibition against unauthorized or
				unlawful reproduction shall include all nations domestic use as well as protections afforded under any international forum
				or law, including, but not limited to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The application of the United Nations
				Convention on the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Access to and use of this website and related content
				is limited to legal purposes and activities, and you are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations including
				but not limited to any applicable local laws in your locality, you agree that you will pay any and all taxes, including but
				not limited to any applicable sales or use taxes and provide us with written proof of payment upon request, and that any
				content licensed to you by us is only for use of content that you are authorized and legally permitted to use. NFOs or other
				creative works, generally, are the physical property of collection holding them, while literary rights, including copyright,
				if any, may belong to the authors or their heirs and assigns. Nothing herein shall be construed as conferring any license or
				right under any copyright, except as explicitly provided in the paragraph on permissions, below. It may be difficult or even
				impossible to determine what copyright or other restrictions may apply to historical collections and archives and permission
				to publish does not constitute a copyright clearance. There are also no model or other releases known to exist for torrents
				on this website. Often the owners only hold the physical rights and/or the electronic rights, possibly non-exclusive, to
				torrents or other content in their collections, and in some instances the original content may be in the public domain
				and/or available elsewhere. We regret that we are unable to provide legal advice regarding rights clearances or other legal
				matters and urge you to consult an intellectual property attorney if you have legal concerns. Photo credits including but
				not limited to statements on this website or in our e-mail(s) that particular torrent(s) or other content is from or
				"Courtesy of [a named donor.]" are included only as a source credit and/or "thank you" for donations and should be
				considered by you when determining what rights clearances may be needed, but may be missing, incomplete, or erroneous and
				may not be relied upon to determine ownership for purposes of obtaining permissions and copyright clearances, nor may any
				donor give you permission to download any torrent or other content from this website, nor shall this website or
				horizon.netlify.app become or be considered a party to any transaction you enter into with any third party, donor, or linked
				website. Description of any third party product, service, or activity or a link thereto does not imply any determination
				regarding its quality, suitability, safety, or lawfulness, which is entirely your responsibility. You stipulate and agree
				that unauthorized copying of one or more torrents or other content from this website in lieu of licensing a sufficient
				number of authorized copies where such work is available for license in the medium or format desired shall be conclusively
				presumed unfair, and, notwithstanding any case law to the contrary, you hereby waive the right to claim or assert that such
				unauthorized copying in lieu of licensing constitutes "fair use" and that any copyright registration granted to us shall be
				conclusively presumed to be a valid copyright of all of the content of this website and all portions thereof in all
				jurisdictions, and that such copyright shall apply to each torrent depicted on this website, and to variations of such
				torrents, including, but not limited to changes in the size, resolution, torrent format, or tangible form of expression. We
				make no representations or warranties with respect to ownership of or copyrights, if any, in torrents or other content on
				this website or obtained from us, and do not represent others who may claim to be authors or owners of copyright or other
				rights thereto. You shall obtain all permission(s) when required and are solely responsible for determining the existence of
				such rights, satisfying any copyright and other use restrictions, intangible rights, or related interests, for obtaining any
				and all permissions and releases, for guarding against the infringement of those rights that may be held elsewhere, and for
				paying any associated fees necessary for the reproduction or use of the materials and for rights to any proprietary material
				depicted, and you expressly assume all responsibility for observing applicable laws of copyright, literary right, trespass,
				conversion, property right, privacy, publicity, and libel. You acknowledge that digital torrents on this website or obtained
				from us are our valuable property, that viewing of torrents and other website content is a valuable consideration, and agree
				that all provisions of this User Agreement including but not limited to use restrictions shall additionally apply on a
				contractual basis regardless of the copyright status of any torrent or other website content.

				not endorse, is not a party to, and takes no responsibility for third party offers whether on a linked website, published on
				this website, or found elsewhere, nor for the persons or entities operating such websites. If you choose to do business with
				such third parties, which you agree is entirely at your own risk, we strongly urge you to check best prices, verify the
				merchant's reputation, and make payments only by credit card so that you will have the possibility of recourse by initiating
				a chargeback should the merchant prove dishonest, and you agree not to complain to us if you don't follow our advice and as
				a result have a problem. All trademarks and brands are the property of their respective owners, and any use of third-party
				trademarks on this website is for nominative and/or descriptive purposes only, and does not imply any third-party

				Service" shown in the internet Whois database) is the "designated agent" to which to report via e-mail alleged copyright
				infringements on this website under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, P.L. 105-304 (or to send other legal notices) and
				such notification should identify in sufficient detail the allegedly infringed copyrighted work (please also specify your

				message, advertisement or any other work found at, aggregated at, contained on, distributed through, linked to or from,
				downloaded to or from or in any other manner accessed, and is confidential to horizon.netlify.app and protected by
				proprietary rights and laws and that disclosure, including but not limited to copying, reproduction, and/or retransmission
				or other unauthorized use, or providing access to this website or its content to anyone who does not accept this User
				Agreement is strictly prohibited, and specifically, but not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to make disclosure
				of such confidential intellectual property and proprietary trade secret information on and comprising this website or
				portion(s) thereof to any third party who has not previously agreed to and is contractually bound to the terms and
				conditions of this User Agreement, and stipulate that such disclosure shall constitute contributory and vicarious
				infringement of our copyright and other rights hereunder. Furthermore, but not in limitation of the foregoing, you stipulate
				and agree that the digital modifications, enhancements, and/or restorations of torrents shown on this website which visually
				distinguish such torrents from the original from which they were derived and/or from other originals or copies thereof are
				trade secrets of such detail and type that human memory cannot retain or duplicate, and that such modifications,
				enhancements, and/or restorations are not apparent from inspection of only the modified torrents, so that the human web
				viewing of such torrents as authorized herein does not make possible disclosure of such trade secret information, and such
				disclosure requires copying by mechanical, electrical, or digital means or the like which is only authorized by specific
				permission. Additionally, any information concerning this website or its affiliates or the contributors to this website or
				their conclusions, views, and/or opinions which is not published on this website is also understood to be proprietary trade
				secret information and you agree not to disclose any such information which may come into your possession which is not
				published on this website and to also treat such information as confidential. In particular, you agree not to disclose or
				publish any information regarding the identity, personally identifiable information, the collections, or the opinions on
				issues of controversy of anonymous or pseudonymous authors or donors, nor, without our permission, attempt to identify,
				locate, or contact them in any way, whether in person, by telephone, or otherwise, nor to violate their rights including but
				not limited to their rights of privacy and publicity. You further agree to take reasonable precautions to prevent any
				unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of confidential or proprietary information, and agree not to use
				confidential or proprietary information for your own or any third party's benefit without our prior written approval, in
				each instance. When communicating with us, you shall not provide us with any materials, writing, torrent, information,
				content, attachment, or data that is confidential to you or any third party, and any notice, legend, or label to the
				contrary shall be without effect, and we shall be free to use anything that we receive from you in any manner that we deem
				appropriate.

				In the event that you disagree with the content, opinions, or policies of this website or its author(s), your sole and
				exclusive remedy shall be to notify us by e-mail, and all changes or corrections, if any, shall be made at our sole
				discretion. You agree not to take any action that will impose a disproportionately large or unreasonable load on our
				computer web server(s), network, or other infrastructure. Please be mindful of the large amounts of data transfer needed to
				allow viewing of the Horizon web pages with multiple, large torrents, and avoid suddenly flooding the Horizon website with
				large numbers of unanticipated visitors. Suddenly increased, excess web traffic on this website as a result of your actions,
				including but not limited to publicity, reporting, or recommendations to others regarding this website on network television
				or radio or national publications or media, of more than one gigabyte of additional Internet data transfer per month, shall
				be at your expense, and you agree to reimburse horizon.netlify.app for the resulting costs at the rate of the then
				prevailing additional data transfer charge made by the Internet provider(s) hosting this website. Access without permission

				<strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT:</strong> You agree that this web page alone constitutes the entire User Agreement, that it is the
				complete and exclusive statement of your agreement with us, constitutes a writing signed by you, supersedes all prior
				agreements and representations between the parties, that no variation of the terms of this User Agreement will be
				enforceable against us, that it is subject to change which shall be effective immediately, and you waive the right to claim,
				contest, or assert that this User Agreement was modified, canceled, superseded, or changed by any oral agreement, purchase
				order, e-mail, notice, or other writing, course of conduct, waiver, implication, or estoppel. This User Agreement shall not
				be canceled, modified, amended or in any way altered, nor may it be modified by custom and usage of trade or course of
				dealing. No one has the authority to vary these terms and conditions, and no purported modification by any person, orally or
				in writing, may be relied upon or deemed binding, and we note our objection thereto, nor shall any writing, undertaking,
				representation, or warranty made by anyone affiliated with this website which is inconsistent with this User Agreement be
				binding. Consequently you may not send us your contracts, offers, requirements, forms, purchase orders, files, gift
				restrictions, confidentiality notices, or other communications containing terms and/or conditions which differ from this
				User Agreement which if received in violation of the foregoing will be ignored if possible, and will have no effect, but
				which may if deemed necessary in our sole discretion be subject to legal review at your expense. Our failure to respond or
				take affirmative action in response to any communication or information sent or provided to us should be understood to mean
				that we did not receive the communication or information, did not read it, chose not to respond, or disagreed, and should
				not be construed to indicate our acquiescence, agreement, approval, or consent. Specifically, but not in limitation of the
				forgoing, this restricted rights website and any related software, data, torrents, or other content are not available for
				licensing to United States Government End Users or others under the terms of FAR 52.227-19 ("COMMERCIAL COMPUTER
				SOFTWARE�RESTRICTED RIGHTS"), but only under the more restrictive terms as set forth herein.
				<br />
				<br />
				Use of a horizon.netlify.app e-mail "from" or "reply-to" address does not mean that the message came from us and even if
				authorized does not imply any such authority or affiliation with horizon.netlify.app or this website, nor an ownership or
				agency relationship, and any claimed authority, title, affiliation, ownership, or relationship by any person or entity not
				stated on this website shall be conclusively presumed to be invalid and may not be relied upon. Any message received from us
				whether by fax, e-mail, or other method, including any attachments, contains confidential information intended for a
				specific individual and purpose and is protected by law. If you are not the intended recipient, please contact the sender
				immediately by reply e-mail or fax and destroy all copies. You are hereby notified that any disclosure, copying, or
				distribution of such a message, or the taking of any action based on it, is strictly prohibited. You are warned that
				computer viruses can be transmitted via e-mail, so the recipient of any e-mail should check it and any attachments for the
				presence of viruses. (Computer viruses and spammers frequently forge e-mail "from" addresses that they copy from infected
				computers or from the world wide web, so, unfortunately, there are many more unlawful e-mails sent pretending to come from
				us than e-mails that we actually send.) Even if the e-mail is legitimate, neither we nor the sender accepts liability for
				any damage caused by any virus transmitted by e-mail. E-mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error-free
				because information could be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed, arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses. The
				sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of any message or attachment, which
				arise as a result of e-mail or other electronic transmission.
				<br />
				<br />
				This User Agreement may be assigned by horizon.netlify.app. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to amend, modify,
				add, remove, or change these terms or portions thereof at any time, without prior notice, and to revoke permission for any
				cause or for no cause. Any changes become effective immediately upon posting of the revised User Agreement on this website,
				so please use a notification service and check this website online periodically for such changes. Contractually imposed use
				restrictions as specified herein may be more restrictive that those of copyright law. Continued use of this website or its
				contents indicates and shall be deemed to constitute your affirmation of your agreement to this entire User Agreement,
				including all such restrictions and any changes. To immediately stop using this website and its content is your only remedy
				should you not agree to any of the terms of this User Agreement, as amended. The terms and conditions of this User Agreement
				shall apply to all torrents, text, e-mail, webpages, and other content and to all our intellectual property wherever
				located, including this website, and including copies thereof in whole or part, or derived therefrom, regardless of the
				form, electronic, printed, or other, whenever or however obtained, including but not limited to when obtained from third
				parties with or without our permission. This website contains thousands of notices regarding this User Agreement, however,
				in the event that the language of such notice(s) is inconsistent with the language herein, the language of this User
				Agreement shall prevail. All notices under this User Agreement shall be in writing, such as e-mail. A printed version of
				this User Agreement shall be admissible in arbitration, judicial, or administrative proceedings to the same extent and
				subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
				This User Agreement, and any e-mail, facsimile, or other communications between you and us that is or can be printed by a
				computer onto paper, whether electronic or on paper, shall be considered to be "in writing" and you should print a paper
				copy of this User Agreement and any such personal electronic communication that is important to you and retain the copy for
				your records. If you are unwilling to receive this User Agreement, licensed content, or other communications from us
				electronically, you may not use this website or otherwise license content from us. Clause or paragraph titles and headings
				are for reading convenience, and hyperlinks are for convenience in accessing related information, and shall be disregarded
				when construing this instrument. References herein to the horizon.netlify.app internet domain shall include any alias or
				mirror domain names or numbers. Receipt and/or use of any donations shall be governed entirely by this User Agreement and
				shall not constitute agreement or acceptance of any additional terms and conditions contained therein which shall be null
				and void. You may not transfer or assign this User Agreement and any such transfer or assignment will be null and void. You
				further agree to refrain from engaging in any conduct that is, or that we determine to be, in violation of this User
				Agreement. You acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to protect against breach of our intellectual property
				rights, as prohibited under this Agreement, and you agree to the granting of injunctive relief without the posting of a bond
				or undertaking, for the protection of terms laid out in this User Agreement without proof of actual damages. You agree to
				undertake at your expense any measures and/or legal actions necessary to protect and defend our intellectual property by
				counsel reasonably accepted by us, and upon request to cooperate with us when we need to do so, and to cooperate with us as
				fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim or in asserting any available defenses. We shall have the right at
				our sole discretion to assume the exclusive control and defense of any matter.
				<br />
				<br />
				Nothing in this Agreement shall create any relationship between us, including but not limited to not creating any joint
				venture, joint employer, franchisee-franchisor, employer-employee, professional-client, organization-member, or
				principal-agent relationship between you and us, nor impose upon us any obligations for any losses, debts, taxes, or other
				obligations incurred by you or as a result of your actions. You agree that any time you expend relating to this website is
				only for your enjoyment and educational purposes and/or your educational hobby or collection and is not labor on behalf of
				us or our website, and that while you may donate property, including intellectual property (for which gifts we are most
				grateful!), you may not and agree not to work on our behalf or donate your labor to us, nor allow us to determine the manner
				or result of your activities or accomplishments, nor shall there be any economic exchange thereby.
				<br />
				<br />
				Time is of the essence hereof. Non-enforcement of any provision herein does not constitute consent or waiver, and we reserve
				the right to enforce such provision at our sole discretion and at any time, without limitation, and regardless of any delay
				after we learn of any violation of the terms and conditions hereof and whether such delay be reasonable or unreasonable, and
				the waiver of any breach of any provision of this User Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or
				subsequent breach, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. If any portion of this agreement shall be held
				unenforceable, invalid or inoperative, then, (a) the remainder of this agreement shall be considered valid and operative,
				and the remaining provisions shall be nevertheless carried into effect, and (b) insofar as it is reasonable and possible,
				effect shall be given to the intent manifested by the portion held unenforceable, invalid or inoperative, and such portion
				shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The language of this User Agreement shall be
				construed as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party. WE WANT TO FULLFILL ANY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE MAY
				HAVE AND CONSEQUENTLY REQUIRE THAT YOU TELL US PROMPTLY IF THERE IS A PROBLEM AND GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE REMEDIAL
				ACTION. IF YOU SHOULD CONCLUDE OR DISCOVER FACTS WHICH REASONABLY INDICATE THAT WE HAVE VIOLATED THIS USER AGREEMENT, OR
				FAILED TO PERFORM ANY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE, OR HAVE BREACHED A LEGAL DUTY, OR THAT WE HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT, YOU ARE
				REQUIRED TO NOTIFY horizon.netlify.app BY E-MAIL AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY BUT WITHIN 12 HOURS, AND TO FOLLOW-UP BY
				PROVIDING ALL KNOWN SPECIFICS AND DETAILS BY E-MAIL NOTIFICATION TO horizonwebapp@gmail.com WITHIN TEN DAYS. IF YOU FAIL TO
				GIVE THE FOREGOING TIMELY NOTICES TO US, YOU SHALL THEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION. You agree that
				regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
				Horizon site or this User Agreement must be filed by you within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action first
				arose, and regardless of when discovered, or be forever barred. The parties hereto stipulate and agree that (1) as the
				physical premises of the Horizon site consist of the site's Internet webserver(s) and storage components thereof, these
				shall be construed as the site's real property, and (2) that the electronic signals created when the website or content
				thereof is used constitute the Horizon site's physical personal property; neither of which shall be trespassed or converted
				by unauthorized entry, access, transfer, or use and our right to exclude others from trespassing and/or converting such
				property or from our virtual network premises is not equivalent to any rights protected by copyright. The parties hereto
				further stipulate and agree that use of this website or the content thereof in violation of this User Agreement causes
				actual and irreparable harm inflicted by such conduct, constitutes a substantial interference with possession or the right
				thereto, and shall give rise to causes of action for trespass, conversion, or the like, false advertising, federal and state
				trademark dilution, computer fraud and abuse, unfair competition, misappropriation, interference with prospective economic
				advantage, unjust enrichment, copyright infringement, and other causes of action as applicable, and that no remedy or
				election we choose shall be deemed exclusive but shall, wherever possible, be cumulative with all other remedies at law or
				in equity, and that each torrent or graphic shall constitute a separate copyrighted work. We reserve the right in our sole
				and unfettered discretion to deny you access to this website at any time for any reason or for no reason.
				<br />
				<br />
				Severe additional penalty for publication of torrents stolen from this website; unlimited liability for subsequent
				infringement: In the event that you do not obtain permission and instead violate this agreement by misappropriating and/or
				publishing unauthorized pirated copies of torrents obtained from this website, or by enabling, permitting, facilitating, or
				encouraging others to do so, a trespass, conversion, or the like, which harms the Horizon Site, for example by causing
				donors to be hesitant or unwilling to allow their torrents to be displayed on the Internet, or if you publish torrents or
				other content prior to making full payment of all applicable fees, or without including the legal notices and credits as
				required herein, you agree to pay a penalty to horizon.netlify.app for each unlicensed use, in addition to any actual and/or
				statutory damages, expenses, and attorney's fees, etc. which may apply, in the amount of fifty (50) times the undiscounted
				commercial fee for licensed use in accordance with this user agreement, agree to assign exclusively to horizon.netlify.app
				copyright and all other ownership rights, including but not limited to physical, contractual, and intellectual property
				rights in any resulting work(s) which contain(s) or which is derived from our intellectual property, this website or its
				torrents or other content, and agree to immediately cease and desist any and all infringement of our copyright or other
				proprietary rights, and of such rights of any third party for which you shall also remain liable. Additionally, please take
				special care to understand that in addition to direct infringement by your theft and republication of our intellectual
				property, or if you otherwise violate the terms of this license, you agree that such violation shall result in your
				unlimited liability for all resulting use and/or infringement by third and subsequent parties who obtain our intellectual
				property from or through you, and you will be held fully responsible (including penalties) � whether or not you have
				knowledge of their actions at the time, whether or not you benefit financially, and whether or not you have the right and/or
				ability to supervise or police such subsequent resulting uses � especially should repeated and unstoppable use by others
				result, and you are specifically prohibited from taking any action that would permit, enable, or facilitate such unpermitted
				or viral distribution, including but not limited to, by others who are not a party to this agreement. [i.e., If you give
				away our torrents or other content without our permission and/or in violation of this agreement, you agree to pay as
				specified in this agreement for all resulting subsequent uses by others which are not authorized by us, whether lawful or
				unlawful, including those resulting uses which you and/or we may, as a result of your actions, then be powerless to control
				or prevent, and possibly may not even discover until after the fact.] Additionally, in the event that your actions in
				violation of this User Agreement result in our being deprived of our exclusive rights to ownership and control of the
				intellectual property we have created in this website and its digital torrents and/or other content in whole or substantial
				part, or of the value thereof, or which would make such intellectual property unsaleable, you agree to pay us liquidated
				damages, the amount of copyright infringement statutory damages per torrent or other content for each and every
				infringement, the appraised market value of this website absent such actions, and the estimated commercial cost to create a
				website of like complexity and content.

				Privacy and Security Statement We do not want, ask for, or need your private information, so it is your responsibility and
				we are relying upon you to select, configure, and operate your computer and networking equipment, operating system, Internet
				browser, e-mail and related software, etc. to protect your privacy and security generally to the extent that you prefer and
				to provide us only with information that you want us to have and use without restriction. We like to be able to give credit
				on this website for donated torrents or other content if donors let us know their full name and/or their website URL. Since
				third parties provide a variety of valuable services such as web hosting [Valueweb.net, & Comcast.net], server logs and site
				statistics, linked websites, hit counters (that also tell us which pages visitors prefer), searching the site's content and
				the web (from which we learn what subject matter visitors are seeking and what search methods are being used), fulfillment
				of book orders, etc., and we have little knowledge and no control over third-party's often inadequate and frequently
				changing privacy and security policies and practices (which unfortunately may not conform to their stated policies), we
				strongly recommend the following minimum general privacy and security measures (among others) which are not specific to this
				website, if and to the extent that you wish to maintain your privacy: (1) use a proxy server that hides your actual IP
				address so that it does not appear in server log files; (2) if you enable cookies which many websites require to operate
				properly (but which we do not currently and never have used, but which are used by third parties), you should erase them at
				least daily; (3) use a browser that withholds the referring URL if you prefer this option; (4) use a hardware stealth
				firewall; (5) regularly use up-to-date virus checking, backup, and disk repair software; (6) use security software that
				attempts to detect and prevent surreptitious capture and transmission of personal identifiers such as names, user-id's or
				numbers, e-mail addresses, unique machine specific identifiers such as your computer's permanent ethernet MAC (Media Access
				Control) address or cookie stored GUID (Globally Unique Identifier), or your actual IP address, (7) use high grade
				encryption for all private, if not all communications; (8) never send confidential information or information not intended
				for publication using any e-mail link on this website; (9) be aware that e-mail addresses appearing on websites are subject
				to abuse by spammers; and, extremely important, (10) block all hosts that do not conform to your expectations of proper
				conduct. No Horizon Site security measures are needed to protect donated information or content or disclosed personally
				identifiable information and affiliation of the donor from being publicly viewed and/or distributed, as and notwithstanding
				any notice to the contrary, it is all intended to be available to horizon.netlify.app for publication.
